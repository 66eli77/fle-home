<p><b>tl;dr</b>&nbsp;A new version of KA Lite is out! You can <a href="http://kalitewiki.learningequality.org/user-s-manual/updating-ka-lite"> update</a> your current version, <a href="http://kalitewiki.learningequality.org/installation">install</a> a new one, or learn how to <a href="http://kalitewiki.learningequality.org/contribute">contribute</a> on the development side.</p> 

<p>It has been a busy summer here at FLE, and we are beyond ready to start sharing with all of you what we’ve been up to! Today, we are incredibly excited for the release of KA Lite version 0.10.0!</p>

<p><b>KA Lite provides many advantages other offline learning products may not</b>: students can practice exercises, teachers can view coach reports, and all this data can be automatically shared across computers whenever an Internet connection is available. The feedback has been clear: <b>people love these features, and want us to do even more to support their ability to</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching">flip the classroom</a>. Here’s a peek at some of the new tools we’ve built to support you!</p>

<p>For everyone:</p>

<ul>
	<li> Way more documentation, including an expanded <a href="http://kalitewiki.learningequality.org/user-s-manual"> user manual </a> on <a href="http://kalitewiki.learningequality.org/"> our wiki </a>.
</ul>

<p>For teachers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Extended coach reports</b> - we now have three types of coach reports: 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>Tabular report</em> for details on student performance on exercises or student engagement with videos, within a particular topic.		
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Scatter report</em> to examine how student effort relates to their mastery.		
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Timeline report</em> to view changes in mastery over time. 		
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b> User usage reports </b> - view login hours per student, on your local server.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Online coach reports</b> - access data for any group or facility online, at <a href="https://kalite.learningequality.org">https://kalite.learningequality.org</a>.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>For admins:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Better performance</b> - we spent a lot of time optimizing performance for this release (e.g. with a robust caching system) while still delivering a completely cross-platform solution.  We have also created <a href="http://kalitewiki.learningequality.org/installation">installation instructions</a> for efficient running on one of the cheapest deployment solution around: the $25 Raspberry Pi.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Synchronization reporting</b> - before, you never knew if and when your server was syncing data.  Now we provide these reports on your install and on our website, so you can verify that everything is working.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Central user usage reports</b> - many of you need to report usage and mastery data to admins and funding sources.  We’ve built an entirely new reporting system to summarize your data, viewable on each installation as well as centrally, through our website. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>More robust subtitles support</b> - we’ve heard your pain in downloading subtitles, and have revamped our system to make things more robust.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b> Detailed documentation</b> - this has been added for <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/learningequality.org/kalite/user-s-manual/using-ka-lite/admins/customizing-the-configuration?pli=1">configuration options</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/learningequality.org/kalite/user-s-manual/using-ka-lite/admins/run-management-commands">management</a> of your system.
	</li> 
</ul>

<p>For students:</p>

<ul>
	<li> 
		<b>Student coach reports</b> - when you log in, you’ll immediately see the progress you’ve made, with direct links to any materials that may have caused you trouble. 
	</li>
	<li> 
		<b>Video indicators</b> - we now have colored links that let you know when videos exist as you navigate through topics.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>More videos</b> - it’s that simple - there are now more Khan Academy videos available in KA Lite to help you learn more!
	</li>
</ul>

<p>While it took us months (and months!) to release this update, we’re already planning the next one. 
<b> Look out for these exciting features in the weeks to come:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>One-click installation and updates</li>
	<li>Completely automated registration for fully streamlined data syncing</li>
	<li>Language packs for a fully translated interface, with even faster subtitle downloads</li>
	<li>Better viewing experience on tablets, and direct viewing from the Raspberry Pi!</li>
	<li>Allowing students to import progress on Khan Academy’s website directly into KA Lite!</li>
	<li>And always… more reporting, more videos, and more learning!</li>
</ul>
