<blockquote>"Not everyone can hop in a van and travel the Americas for a year. One family has, with KA Lite along for the ride.”</blockquote>

<p>In February 2013, the budding FLE team received an email from a family who, in more than one way, is a little too cool for school. Jennifer, Witt and Quinn Sparks had written to inform the team that they'd decided to take a trip across the continental Americas, beginning in their home of Denver, Colorado, then driving all the wya up to Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, and then all the way down to Ushuaia, Argentina</p>

<p>Jennifer Sparks has been interested in education for several years and is a regular follower of several education-related online news sources. During the buildup to the trip, Jennifer went on a mission to find a source of educational materials for our 4-year-old son, Quinn, that they would be able to use on the road without a consistent Internet connection. She heard about KA Lite through Khan Academy's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/khanacademy">Facebook page</a> and was immediately intrigued. After learning more about the project, the family was so excited about the potential for impact that they decided to help install KA Lite in offline communities that they will be visiting during their travels. Partnering with our team at FLE as well as the volunteer program <a href="http://www.dogoodasyougo.org/">Do Good as You Go</a>, the Sparks have already installed KA Lite in two communities in Canada: the Napi Friendship Center in Pincher Creek, Alberta, Canada and the Inuvik Youth Centre in Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada</p>

<p>We highly recommend taking a good look at the Spark's blog which details their KA Lite installations, as well as their travels! If you're interested in learning more about the trip, visit the Sparks' <a href="http://whensparksfly.org/?page_id=28">Volunteering Page</a>. Below is just a quick excerpt from their most recent installation, <a href="http://whensparksfly.org/?p=484">"Volunteering at the Inuvik Youth Center"</a> to give you a taste:

<blockquote><p><em>"We got the software installed without too much trouble, and Doris started putting out the word that there was something new on the computer to see. In part, this involved shouting over to the kids riding in the nearby skate park. Quite convenient!
The next afternoon we got about 8 boys into the center, aged from about 8 – 12. Jen put together a few short demonstrations of some of the Khan Academy videos, including one particularly pertinent about why the sun never sets in the summertime above the arctic circle!</p>

<p>To the extent that you can keep pre-teen boys’ attention with educational videos, the demonstrations went quite well. About a half an hour later it was the girls’ turn – the “Delta Girls” in particular, referring the Mackenzie River delta. We felt that the whole exercise turned out very well. <b>Our hope is that we’ve made something available that will help a few people out, if and when they decide they need it."</b></p></em></blockquote>

<p>You can continue tracking the Sparks’ progress on their personal site: <a href="whensparksfly.org">whensparksfly.org</a>. In the meantime, we are glad that so many are finding KA Lite to be useful.
