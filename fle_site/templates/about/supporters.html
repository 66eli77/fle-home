                OLE International is committed to removing the barriers to learning so that all of our children enjoy learning that is open, free and meaningful, enabling them to become, in their own ways, productive, life-long learners and leaders which is a requirement for a sustainable world. The Foundation for Learning Equality is collaborating with OLE on ways to help make this shared vision a reality.

                is part of the <a href="http://www.khanidaho.org/">Khan in Idaho</a> program, the FLE has partnered with the NNU Center of Innovation in Teaching and the CCA to bring KA Lite to inmates across 7 facilities of the Idaho Department of Corrections.  This year-long study will examine the efficacy of Khan Academy content, and we hope it might serve as a launching pad to bring KA Lite to prisons across the nation.
