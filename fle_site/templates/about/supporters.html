      The Foundationâ€™s current activities are focused around developing the KA Lite platform further and helping to support its deployment through partner NGOs, as well as individual teachers and schools wanting to make use of the platform with their students. We have been in discussions with hundreds of organizations, schools, and individuals around the world, many of whom are now deploying KA Lite in classrooms and homes, and have several larger pilot programs underway.

                is part of the <a href="http://www.khanidaho.org/">Khan in Idaho</a> program, the FLE has partnered with the NNU Center of Innovation in Teaching and the CCA to bring KA Lite to inmates across 7 facilities of the Idaho Department of Corrections.  This year-long study will examine the efficacy of Khan Academy content, and we hope it might serve as a launching pad to bring KA Lite to prisons across the nation.

                is a public charter school that serves a diverse, lottery-selected student population from around San Diego County. As many students don't have internet access in their homes, we're helping to find ways to make online learning resources available to them outside of the classroom.
