        		<h1>Intern at FLE</h1>
	            <h3>and help 4.5 BILLION people access a free education</h3>

	            <p>We are a group of hackers, educators, and humanitarians that <strong>eat the digital divide for breakfast</strong>. We believe that regardless of their nationality, gender, or social status, <strong>everyone around the world should have access to a free, high-quality education</strong>. And we need your help to make it happen!</p>

	            <p><strong>Help the people that really need it.</strong><br/> There’s an amazing online learning revolution going on in the developed world right now, with organizations like Khan Academy, Coursera, and EdX leading the charge to bring high-quality educational content and learning systems to the masses for free. There’s just one small problem... only about 35% of the world’s population has internet access, leaving around 4.5 billion without the chance to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity.</p>

	            <p><strong>Provide access to education all over the world.</strong><br/> You’ll work on software platforms that will be used in some of the most remote places on earth, and then some. Our first platform, KA Lite, has been installed in over 85 countries. Check out this sweet map of known installs:</p>

	            <p><strong>Take on global challenges.</strong><br/> When you join the FLE team, you’ll be taking on personal responsibility for making high-quality, open-licensed educational content accessible to everyone, and that’s not an easy problem to solve.  You’ll have to find creative solutions to questions like these: How do you provide access to open-licensed educational materials in places with no Internet connectivity? How do you design a low-cost solution that works in every deployment scenario possible, including classrooms with no power, access to paved roads, or even rooftops?</p>
