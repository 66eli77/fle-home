Khan in Idaho is a partnership between Khan Academy, Northern Nazarene University\u2019s Center of Innovation in Teaching, and the state of Idaho to bring Khan Academy into 47 schools. Since September, Khan Academy content has been used as a central part of student curriculum in each of these schools. The <a href='http://www.idoc.idaho.gov/'>Idaho Department of Corrections</a> (IDOC) was among the educational institutions selected for the program, but for security reasons their learners are not permitted Internet access - a perfect use case for KA Lite!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe FLE has partnered with the IDOC, their administrative partners at the <a href='http://www.cca.com/'>Corrections Corporation of America</a> (CCA), and the NNU Center of Innovation in Teaching, to deploy Khan Academy learning resources to over 1,000 inmates through the installation of KA Lite in <a href='http://www.idoc.idaho.gov/content/locations'>7 Idaho prisons</a>. This marks the largest deployment of KA Lite that we have actively supported to date.  This partnership, which began with a joint teacher training session on June 18,  launched KA Lite to IDOC inmates on September 3rd. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post-image\">\r\n\t<img class=\"img-thumbnail\" src=\"../../../media/attach/2013/ka-lite-brings-offline-education-idaho-department-/IDOC1.jpg \" alt=\"FLE and NNU team member trainings.\">\r\n\t<p class=\"center-text\">\r\n\t\t<small>\r\n\t\t\tThe FLE team sharing tips with IDOC educators during the September training sessions.\r\n\t\t</small>\r\n\t</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven before the official release, we were already starting to see some exciting results: among inmates who piloted KA Lite at the Cottonwood facility, 20 of 20 students passed their math GEDs! This is unprecedented in IDOC classrooms, and teachers credited this newfound level of success to the use of KA Lite.

Having a KA Lite Support category enables our users to search common issues, such as configuring, using, and installing KA Lite from old threads, as well as to receive support from other members on the forum.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>KA Lite in Your Area</b>\r\n<p>We have heard some of our deployment groups would like to reach out to other local groups that also use KA Lite in the same area, and we have listened to that feedback! Therefore, we opened the  <a href=\"http://forums.learningequality.org/category/ka-lite-deployments\">KA Lite Deployments category</a> that facilitates local deployments connecting with one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>Time to Learn</b>\r\n<p>Our <a href=\"http://forums.learningequality.org/category/tutorial\">Tutorial category</a> is for instructional posts that describe how to set up and work with KA Lite. We will post tutorial videos here periodically. If you made a tutorial for another deployment, feel free to share it in this category.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>Time to get started!</b>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://forums.learningequality.org/\">Join the community</a> and introduce yourself on the forum!

There\u2019s just one catch: we know that there are bugs hiding in the code, and we need your help to report them to us. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to get the beta</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nFor your OS, follow the <a href=\"http://kalitewiki.learningequality.org/installation\">instructions for installing KA Lite</a>. Note to windows users: follow the \u201cDeveloper Instructions\u201d from the bottom half of the Windows installation page--you cannot (yet) use the Windows Installer for getting i18n support.\r\nFrom the command prompt, within the <code>ka-lite</code> directory run <code>git checkout release-0.11</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\u2019s it!  To install languages and have access to dubbed videos, visit the \u201cUpdate\u201d page within KA Lite.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What kind of bugs will I find?</h3>\r\n<p>Great question! There are really two types of bugs to expect in this release: <strong>software bugs</strong> and <strong>translation bugs.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Software Bugs</strong></h4>\r\n<p>This is when you get a screen that you shouldn't. Just clicked a link that didn't take you anywhere? Software bug. Reach a page that says nothing, or just has a big \"Error\" sign with unintelligible techno-babble beneath it, sometimes in an unfriendly red color? Definitely a software bug. Trying to download things that aren't downloading? You guessed it. Software bug. But before we tell you how to report them, let's make sure it's not a translation bug</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Translation Bugs</strong></h4>\r\n<p>A translation bug is a much less serious problem, but definitely still something we need you to report. Did you download a language pack, switch into that language, and nothing happened? Translation bug. Did you switch into your language successfully, and then notice the whole navigation bar is still in English? Translation bug. If you find a translation bug, please don't report it to us through GitHub. Instead, just email a description of what happened, with a screenshot, to <a href=\"mailto:i18n@learningequality.org\">i18n@learningequality.org</a>. If you're sure it's a software bug, please read on to learn how to report them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>How you can help us report software bugs</strong></h4>\r\n<p>We use GitHub to log our issues. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, GitHub is a really helpful tool for developers that lets us host our source code online and collaborate as we make changes to it. Anyway, if you find a bug, or something that doesn't seem to be working right in the beta version you download, here's how you can report it. If you don\u2019t have one yet, please <a href=\"https://github.com/\">make a GitHub account</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Steps to report bugs:</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite/issues\">https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite/issues</a></li>\r\n<li>Click the green \u201cNew Issue\u201d button in the upper-right corner of the web page.</li> \r\n<li>Put a good, clear title in the \u201cTitle\u201d box</li>\r\n<ul><li>a good title will be descriptive and specific like: \u201c404 not found on Device Management page\u201d vs a bad title like: \u201cpage doesn\u2019t work\u201d</li></ul>\r\n<li>In the comment box, be sure to include the following:</li>\r\n<ul><li>A screenshot of the entire page where you found the bug</li>\r\n<li>The exact steps it would take to make the bug happen again. For example: \u201cFirst I clicked \u2018Watch\u2019 in the navigation bar, and then KA Lite just exploded!\u201d</li>\r\n<li>Your operating system and browser.

Just clicked a link that didn't take you anywhere? Software bug. Reach a page that says nothing, or just has a big \"Error\" sign with unintelligible techno-babble beneath it, sometimes in an unfriendly red color? Definitely a software bug. Trying to download things that aren't downloading? You guessed it. Software bug. But before we tell you how to report them, let's make sure it's not a translation bug</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Translation Bugs</strong></h4>\r\n<p>A translation bug is a much less serious problem, but definitely still something we need you to report. Did you download a language pack, switch into that language, and nothing happened? Translation bug. Did you switch into your language successfully, and then notice the whole navigation bar is still in English? Translation bug. If you find a translation bug, please don't report it to us through GitHub. Instead, just email a description of what happened, with a screenshot, to <a href=\"mailto:i18n@learningequality.org\">i18n@learningequality.org</a>. If you're sure it's a software bug, please read on to learn how to report them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>How you can help us report software bugs</strong></h4>\r\n<p>We use GitHub to log our issues. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, GitHub is a really helpful tool for developers that lets us host our source code online and collaborate as we make changes to it. Anyway, if you find a bug, or something that doesn't seem to be working right in the beta version you download, here's how you can report it. If you don\u2019t have one yet, please <a href=\"https://github.com/\">make a GitHub account</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Steps to report bugs:</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite/issues\">https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite/issues</a></li>\r\n<li>Click the green \u201cNew Issue\u201d button in the upper-right corner of the web page.</li> \r\n<li>Put a good, clear title in the \u201cTitle\u201d box</li>\r\n<ul><li>a good title will be descriptive and specific like: \u201c404 not found on Device Management page\u201d vs a bad title like: \u201cpage doesn\u2019t work\u201d</li></ul>\r\n<li>In the comment box, be sure to include the following:</li>\r\n<ul><li>A screenshot of the entire page where you found the bug</li>\r\n<li>The exact steps it would take to make the bug happen again. For example: \u201cFirst I clicked \u2018Watch\u2019 in the navigation bar, and then KA Lite just exploded!\u201d</li>\r\n<li>Your operating system and browser. For example: \u201cWindows 7, Chrome\u201d</li></ul></ol>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite/issues/1489\">Click here</a> for an example of an issue with ample description and screenshots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>tl;dr</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>stable release of i18n has been delayed from 2/19 to mid-March</li>\r\n<li>We\u2019re releasing the beta on Friday</li>\r\n<li>Instructions on how to get it above</li>\r\n<li>Please, please help us find bugs and report them!

They watched videos, mastered exercise sets, and spent time collaborating on ideas and solutions to the problems they encountered. Once again, this cooperation proved that this was not an individual journey for each student, but instead a collective effort to help each other, and ultimately, help themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post-image\">\r\n\t<img class=\"img-thumbnail\" src=\"../../../media/attach/2014/samuel-morris-scholars-program-unforgettable-impac/image029.jpg\" alt=\"Sharing KA Lite\" />\r\n\t<p class=\"center-text\">\r\n\t\t<small>\r\n\t\t\tStudents shared laptops, which encouraged collaborative learning and cooperation. \r\n\t\t</small>\r\n\t</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the third day of instruction, the students were given a post-test to reveal their progress after using KA Lite for three consecutive days to learn mathematics.

Over the following 3 days, each of these students participated in six sessions of about an hour to an hour and a half in length, twice each day.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post-image\">\r\n\t<img class=\"img-thumbnail\" src=\"../../../media/attach/2014/samuel-morris-scholars-program-unforgettable-impac/image026.jpg\" alt=\"Excited about KA Lite\" />\r\n\t<p class=\"center-text\">\r\n\t\t<small>\r\n\t\t\tOne student beams at the camera as she starts using the laptop.\r\n\t\t</small>\r\n\t</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There were sixteen laptops set up in two different classrooms, with students paired and matched to computers based on their basic math abilities, determined by pre-testing before the program began. Unsurprisingly, their scores were overall extremely low, representative of the challenges facing post-war rural Liberia\u2019s educational system.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post-image\">\r\n\t<img class=\"img-thumbnail\" src=\"../../../media/attach/2014/samuel-morris-scholars-program-unforgettable-impac/image018.jpg\" alt=\"Students were all smiles as they learned to navigate laptops\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin using KA Lite, the students first had to learn to familiarize themselves with the computers, as many had never seen or used a computer before. In order to learn how to use the mouse, the keyboard, and other basic functions of the computer, students worked together and used a variety of instructional programs.  The initial teamwork and collaboration showed that the students were collectively engaged in the learning process, and willing to help one another as they embarked on this unforgettable learning opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post-image\">\r\n\t<img class=\"img-thumbnail\" src=\"../../../media/attach/2014/samuel-morris-scholars-program-unforgettable-impac/image022.jpg\" alt=\"Excited about KA Lite\" />\r\n\t<p class=\"center-text\">\r\n\t\t<small>\r\n\t\t\tStudents were all smiles as they learned to navigate laptops for the first time.\r\n\t\t</small>\r\n\t</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post-image\">\r\n\t<img class=\"img-thumbnail\" src=\"../../../media/attach/2014/samuel-morris-scholars-program-unforgettable-impac/image023.jpg\" alt=\"Using KA Lite\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Students were given a \u201cSamuel Morris Scholars Program\u201d t-shirt that all of them wore enthusiastically for the remainder of the program, and that will serve as a physical reminder of this unique experience. Samuel Morris was a young Liberian, son of a Kru tribal chief who, in 1891, found his way to the United States and Taylor University, and dramatically impacted the future of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post-image\">\r\n\t<img class=\"img-thumbnail\" src=\"../../../media/attach/2014/samuel-morris-scholars-program-unforgettable-impac/image032.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel Morris shirts and KA Lite\" />\r\n\t<p class=\"center-text\">\r\n\t\t<small>\r\n\t\t\tStudents wearing their Samuel Morris shirts while working through their math lessons. \r\n\t\t</small>\r\n\t</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>By the second day of instruction, the children had learned to login to the program and were eagerly getting to work. They watched videos, mastered exercise sets, and spent time collaborating on ideas and solutions to the problems they encountered. Once again, this cooperation proved that this was not an individual journey for each student, but instead a collective effort to help each other, and ultimately, help themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post-image\">\r\n\t<img class=\"img-thumbnail\" src=\"../../../media/attach/2014/samuel-morris-scholars-program-unforgettable-impac/image029.jpg\" alt=\"Sharing KA Lite\" />\r\n\t<p class=\"center-text\">\r\n\t\t<small>\r\n\t\t\tStudents shared laptops, which encouraged collaborative learning and cooperation. \r\n\t\t</small>\r\n\t</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the third day of instruction, the students were given a post-test to reveal their progress after using KA Lite for three consecutive days to learn mathematics.
