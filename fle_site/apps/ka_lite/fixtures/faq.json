      "answer": "<p>\r\nWe have transitioned from using standard BitTorrent to using <a href=\"http://www.bittorrent.com/sync\">BitTorrent Sync</a>, as this allows us to add new videos or fix problems without issuing a whole new torrent file and then having seeders split between the old and new torrent files. Here are the steps to set this up:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/downloads\">Download and install BitTorrent Sync</a></li>\r\n<li>Run BT Sync. On some platforms, this will bring up a graphical interface. On Linux, you will need to then load <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8888/\">http://127.0.0.1:8888/</a> to get the interface.</li>\r\n<li>Add a folder, using \"BT7AOITNAIP3X3CSLE2EPQJFXJXMXVGQI\" (no quotes) as the secret, and the \"content\" folder inside your KA Lite installation as the \"path\" (unless you want the videos going somewhere else).</li>\r\n<li>Allow the videos to sync in there from your peers! It may take a while for now, as we don't yet have many seeders on it. On that note -- <b>please help seed by keeping it running even after you've got all the videos</b>, if you have the bandwidth to spare! This to will make it easier for others to download the content as well!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Please note that these are resized videos. All in all, this will take just over 20GB of space.</p> \r\n\r\n<p> \r\nOnce you have the videos, you need to tell KA Lite where to find them by following <a href=\"http://kalitewiki.learningequality.org/user-s-manual/using-ka-lite/admins/customizing-the-configuration/using-downloaded-videos-from-outside-your-ka-lite-directory\">the instructions on our wiki.</a>\r\n</p>",
