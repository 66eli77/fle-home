                <h3>and help 4.5 BILLION people access a free education</h3>    
            </div>
            <p>We are a group of hackers, educators, and humanitarians that <strong>eat the digital divide for breakfast</strong>. We believe that regardless of their nationality, gender, or social status, <strong>everyone around the world should have access to a free, high-quality education</strong>. And we need your help to make it happen!</p>

            <p><strong>Help the people that really need it.</strong><br/> There’s an amazing online learning revolution going on in the developed world right now, with organizations like Khan Academy, Coursera, and EdX leading the charge to bring high-quality educational content and learning systems to the masses for free. There’s just one small problem... only about 35% of the world’s population has internet access, leaving around 4.5 billion without the chance to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity.</p>

            <p><strong>Provide access to education all over the world.</strong><br/> You’ll work on software platforms that will be used in some of the most remote places on earth, and then some. Our first platform, KA Lite, has been installed in over 140 countries. Check out this sweet map of known installs:</p>

            </a>

            <p><strong>Take on global challenges.</strong><br/>When you join the FLE team, you’ll be taking on personal responsibility for making high-quality, open-licensed educational content accessible to everyone, and that’s not an easy problem to solve.  You’ll have to find creative solutions to questions like these: How do you provide access to open-licensed educational materials in places with no Internet connectivity? How do you design a low-cost solution that works in every deployment scenario possible, including classrooms with no power, access to paved roads, or even rooftops?</p>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <dl id="faq">
                <dt>When can I apply?</dt>
                <dd>We accept applications throughout the year, with start dates typically coinciding with the start of quarters at UCSD (~January, April, July, and October).</dd>
                <dt>How much time will I have to commit?</dt>
                <dd>We ask that all interns commit to a minimum of 10 hours a week of in-office time (the more the better!) and we give you the freedom to set the total duration for your internship, with a minimum of 2 months (ideally longer, so you can really gear up and make big contributions).</dd>
                <dt>Is this a paid internships or unpaid?</dt>
                <dd>At the moment, internships start out as unpaid, and the goal is to help you learn as much as possible, so we provide a lot of training. However, in a number of cases interns have gone on to join us for either full-time or part-time positions, so it's a good way to get your foot in the door!</dd>
                <dt>Where are the internships located?</dt>
                <dd>Our offices are on the UCSD campus in San Diego, California. Also known as America's Finest City, and home to Ron Burgundy, among other fine people. We can also consider the possibility of remote internships, if you don't have a way to get to San Diego.</dd>
                <dt>I'm a UCSD student. Can I get 199 credit?</dt>
                <dd>Yes, we collaborate with faculty and graduate students, through whom we can give COGS 199 class credit.</dd>
                <dt>How does the application process work?</dt>
                <dd>After the application is submitted, we will review your application and be in touch via email within 14 days to schedule an interview and ask specific follow up questions.</dd>
