            <p>Don’t just use this technique because you can: video content must amplify a site’s message, not just be shown because it’s pretty. The video will likely be set to autoplay, but it should be muted by default; ideally, it should not include sound at all. (You can easily create an unmute button for the video with JavaScript). The video should display a placeholder image, falling back to a static background image for browsers that do not support HTML5. The placeholder image will also be used a background on mobile devices: most phones and tablets do not support autoplay, for obvious reasons. Length is important: too short a video can feel repetitive (as most such videos will be set to loop), while too long becomes a narrative unto itself, and therefore deserving to be a separate design element. I’d suggest a run time of approximately 12 – 30 seconds. Accessibility is important: any text placed on top of the video should be in high contrast. Users should have easy access to a UI control to pause the video; ideally, the video should play through only once.</p>
