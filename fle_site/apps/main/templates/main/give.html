                    The Foundation for Learning Equality (FLE) actively develops and maintains open-source software that helps thousands of learners all over the world access the same high-quality educational materials available on the Internet that their peers in the developed world take for granted.

                    By making a contribution to FLE, you'll be supporting the further development of KA Lite, and future tools for the sharing and creation of open-licensed educational content for use by anyone around the world.
